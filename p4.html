History of Programming Languages
The first computer program was created by Charles Babbage in the early 19th century to run his conceptual Analytical Engine. The Analytical Engine would be able to calculate logarithms and trigonometric functions using his computer program. His original ideas, combined with various mathematical works throughout the late 19th century and early 20th century, were used by Alan M. Turing in his Turing Machines. These machines were conceptualized in the late 1930s and they worked by manipulating various symbols written on a tape. These concepts gave birth to the ideas of computer memory, automated machines, and the basic working of the modern day CPU. The last of the primitive programming languages was used in the famous ENIAC and UNIVAC computers of the late 1940s and early 50s.

Before 1954 almost all programming was done in assembly language. Modern structured programming languages first appeared in the computers of the 1950s and 60s. The initial modern programming languages FORTRAN, LISP, ALGOL, and COBOL became the basis of the computing world in the middle of the 20th century, and many variations of these languages spawned a multitude of new languages. Modified versions or FORTRAN, LISP, ALGOL and COBOL are still used in 21st century machines. As computers became more efficient and accessible to the public, programming languages were forced to match the increasing complexities associated with the vast increase of technology until the early 1970s.
